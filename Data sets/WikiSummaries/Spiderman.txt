Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark is a musical with music and lyrics by Bono and The Edge, and a book by Julie Taymor and Glen Berger, with revisions by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa.
The musical is based on the Spider-Man comics created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, published by Marvel Comics, as well as the 2002 film and the Greek myth of Arachne. It tells Spider-Man's origin story, his romance with Mary Jane and his battles with the Green Goblin. The show includes highly technical stunts, such as aerial combat scenes and actors swinging from "webs".The Broadway production was notorious for its many troubles. Several actors were injured performing stunts and the opening night was repeatedly pushed back to give the creative team more time to work, causing some critics to review the 'unfinished' production in protest. Following negative reviews, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark suspended performances for a month to retool the show. Long-time Spider-Man comics writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa was brought in to revise the story and book. Director Julie Taymor, whose vision had driven the concept of the musical, was replaced by creative consultant Philip William McKinley. By the time Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark officially opened on June 14, 2011, it had set the record for the longest preview period in Broadway history â€“ 182 performances.Critical reception of the opening was better than for the previews, but mixed, with praise for the visual effects but little enthusiasm for the book and score. Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark is the most expensive Broadway production in history, and also once held the box office record for Broadway sales in one week, taking in $2.9 million over nine performances. The production closed on January 4, 2014.
