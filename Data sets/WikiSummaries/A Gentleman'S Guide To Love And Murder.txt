A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder is a musical comedy, with the book and lyrics by Robert L. Freedman and the music and lyrics by Steven Lutvak. It is based on the 1907 novel Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal by Roy Horniman.  The show opened on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre November 17, 2013, running until January 17, 2016. The Broadway production won four Tonys at the 68th Tony Awards in June 2014, including Best Musical.
The novel was also the source for the 1949 British film Kind Hearts and Coronets; however, after a lengthy legal battle, the infringement claim from the film's copyright holder was dismissed. A small production of the show was also performed in 2004 under the same name of the 1949 film.
