The Visit is a musical with a book by Terrence McNally, lyrics by Fred Ebb, and music by John Kander.
Based on Friedrich DÃ¼rrenmatt's 1956 satirical play about greed and revenge Der Besuch der alten Dame, it focuses on one of the world's wealthiest women, Claire Zachanassian, who returns to her financially depressed hometown and offers its residents a new lease on life in exchange for the murder of Anton Schell, the man who abandoned her years ago.
