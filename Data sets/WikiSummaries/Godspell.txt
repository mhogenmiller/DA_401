Godspell is a musical composed by Stephen Schwartz with the book by John-Michael Tebelak. The show opened off-Broadway on May 17, 1971, and has since been produced by multiple touring companies and in many revivals. The 2011 revival played on Broadway from October 13, 2011 through June 24, 2012. 
The musical is structured as a series of parables, primarily based on the Gospel of Matthew. However, four of the featured parables are only recorded in the Gospel of Luke, and the narrative of the woman taken in adultery is only in the Gospel of John. The parables are interspersed with music set primarily to lyrics from traditional hymns, with the passion of Christ appearing briefly near the end of the show. 
Godspell began as a project by the drama students at Carnegie Mellon University, then moved to the off-off-Broadway theater La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan. The show was then re-scored for an off-Broadway production, which became a long-running success. An abbreviated one-act version of the musical has been produced under the title Godspell Junior.Several cast albums have been released over the years. "Day by Day", from the original cast album, reached #13 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the summer of 1972.
