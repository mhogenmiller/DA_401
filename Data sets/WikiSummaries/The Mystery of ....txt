The Mystery of Edwin Drood (or simply Drood) is a musical based on the unfinished Charles Dickens novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood.  It is written by Rupert Holmes, and was the first Broadway musical with multiple endings (determined by audience vote). Holmes received Tony Awards for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score.  The musical won five Tony Awards out of eleven nominations, including Best Musical and Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical.
The musical debuted as part of the New York Shakespeare Festival in August 1985, and, following revision, transferred to Broadway, where it ran until May 1987. Two national tours and a production in London's West End followed.  The Roundabout Theatre Company revived the musical as The Mystery of Edwin Drood in 2012.
