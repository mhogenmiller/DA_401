Disaster! is a musical comedy created by Seth Rudetsky, and written by Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick.  Earthquakes, tidal waves, infernos and the  songs of the '70s take center stage in this homage to classic disaster films.
The show debuted at Triad Theatre, now renamed Stage 72, with choreography by Denis Jones and music supervision by Steve Marzullo on January 22, 2012 and ran through March 25 in its first production. A second production ran from November 2013 through April 2014 at New York's St. Luke's Theatre. The show opened on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre on March 8, 2016, with previews beginning on February 9, 2016.  The show starred Rudetsky, along with Roger Bart, Kerry Butler, Kevin Chamberlin, Adam Pascal, Faith Prince, Rachel York, Max Crumm, and Jennifer Simard.  Baylee Littrell (the son of Brian Littrell) and Lacretta Nicole made their Broadway debut. The show closed on May 8, 2016, after playing 32 previews and 72 regular performances.Disaster! parodies and pays comedic tribute to the genre of 1970s disaster films. In this musical, a group of New Yorkers attends the opening of a floating casino and discoth√®que that quickly succumbs to multiple disasters. These calamities correlate with plots of various disaster films of the 1970s, such as earthquakes or killer bee incidents, echoing situations from the films Earthquake and The Swarm respectively. Additionally, this play keeps with a 1970s theme by being a jukebox musical, using popular songs of the decade as musical numbers.
