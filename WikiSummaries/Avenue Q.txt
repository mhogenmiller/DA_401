Avenue Q is a musical comedy featuring puppets and human actors with music and lyrics by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx and book by Jeff Whitty. The show won Best Musical, Book, and Score at the 2004 Tony Awards. The show was directed by Jason Moore with puppets designed and built by original cast member Rick Lyon. Avenue Q has received many favorable reviews for its approach on topics like racism.
The show first opened in 2003 at the Vineyard Theatre co-produced by the Vineyard Theatre and The New Group. In July of that same year the show moved to the John Golden Theatre on Broadway. Avenue Q would go on to play over 2,500 performances, ranking 24th on the list of longest running shows in Broadway history, before moving to New World Stages where it will play its final performance on April 28, 2019. Because of the show’s success on Broadway many international tours have spawned in places like Germany, England, and Hong Kong. While these tours went on, a school friendly script was produced. The rights to the musical were also released.
The principal cast includes 4 puppeteers and 3 human actors. The puppets, Princeton, Kate, Nicky, and others, are played by unconcealed puppeteers alongside costumed human actors. The show’s format is a parody of PBS's Sesame Street.
